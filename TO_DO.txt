Meeting 26-10:
    V Rename "frshwater flux" in "Net mass flux of sea ice melting (nmfSIm)"
    V Verify if the CRYOSAT biweekly are averaged data or snapshot data?
    V Compute the distance on the grid (is it 80km everywhere?)
    V Consider a biweekly freshwater flux and not a daily to have a better use of the temporal grid data
    V Are the trend significant?
    V An increase of EKE and KE are observed near the Den Strait? Is it significant? Is the current more meandering?
    V Ask Noe Pirlet about ERA5 2012 file
    V Correlation between KE and EKE
    V IMPORTANT: diagnostic if my fresh water flux is well computed. In year averaged, the net sea ice melt has to be positive
      over all the Greenland sea.
    - Compute the baroclinic component of the geostrophic current, it is this component which is modified by the sea ice melt.
      So, I need the vertical profile of temperature and salinity and use the dynamical method.


    - Problem with the mensual mean in the plot's function. End of month (31) should be count for the next month
    - Difference between nmfsim computed as I did or with divergence? -> Done but verify the divergence method
